About me


I worked as a full stack software engineer for 8 years in the finance and insurance industries.  I'm now inspired 

Skills and knowledge can take many different forms.  In this context, the obvious form is technical software development.  The methodical processes I apply to hone and sharpen 


I think through problems & systems thoroughly.

Continual learning - I learn best by doing. Usually I start in a controlled isolated environment and slowly add variable and uncertainty until the environment becomes vast and complex, so that I'm still absorbing feedback and further honing my skills

Continual incremental inprovement - I love the feeling looking back on my craft 

Values:
Mastery - I desire to have a deep understanding of subject matter and sharply hone skills.  
Emotional Resilliance -
